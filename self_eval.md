# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
 Reflecting on what I learned today is how the structure of methods work and how to define them, this was a proccess of plug and play but when it worked knowing how to use different methods and defining the varibles was very satisfying. I will continue learning how to define methods more and use the proper terminology with more advance methods later on.

- What is the power of using methods in our applications?
The power of methods in applications is immense they help define key points of information that the user will need to run the application or looking for the information they need. Looking at how methods work they make details specific and the input of multiple varibles into the method then shortens it down doing the calculations for the user is very intresting. Understanding this proccess makes me want to learn more about how many different ways methods work and run.
